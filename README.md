# ChiliChecker

<p align="justify">Many people struggle to identify different types of chili peppers and understand their unique characteristics, which hinders culinary experimentation. Chili peppers come in a variety of shapes, sizes, colors, and heat levels, each with a distinct flavor. The lack of accessible information often leads to consumer confusion. ChiliChecker is an app designed to speed up chili identification and offer personalized recipe recommendations. With a simple interface, users can find different chili varieties and access detailed information about their flavor and uses. The app provides customized recipes based on the type of chili detected, a description of the chili variety, the market price range, and how to care for the chili variety.</p>
